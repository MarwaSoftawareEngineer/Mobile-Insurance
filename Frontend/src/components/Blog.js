            <h3 class="introduce">
              Smartphones, tablets and other computers have quickly become
              indispensable elements of our daily lives. For many people, it
              would be almost unthinkable, if not impossible today, to live even
              a single day without a mobile phone. But then, given such use,
              what about the risks? Breakage, theft, breakdownâ€¦ Our beloved
              smartphone is not immune to some problems. Hence the interest of
              taking out portable insurance.

              Mobile insurance, as its name suggests, will protect you
              financially from any incident affecting your smartphone, 
              as part of its use. It will therefore not concern the owner of the
              device, but the device itself.

                Even if you're careful, accidents happen. Mobile insurance can
                cover the cost of repairs or replacements if your phone is
                dropped, cracked, or water damaged.
